# Movie Recommendation System
The Movie Recommendation System is a data-driven application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It utilizes a dataset containing information about millions of movies, including their titles, genres, ratings, and user reviews. By analyzing this data, the system generates personalized movie recommendations for each user.
